From this project, I demonstrated that I can:
Create a main page and a hyperlink to other pages.
Insert images to pages.
Created ordered and un-ordered lists.

Comparing to otheres':
I realized I should use <div> </div> to divide different parts of my code for better readability.

To create a "Return to top" link, I can use:
<a href="#header">Return to top</a>

To do this, I need to create an 'id' for my whatever I want my header to be like:
<h1 id='header'>Charlie's Milk Steak</h1>
